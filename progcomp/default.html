      <h2>Spring 2024 Programming Competition</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.winthrop.edu/cba/computing-and-information-sciences/">Computing &amp; Information Sciences</a> department at the 
         <a href="https://winthrop.edu/cba">College of Business Administration</a> at <a href="https://winthrop.edu">Winthrop University</a> 
         is hosting a <i>programming competition</i> on Saturday, March 30, 2024.  The competition is open to any Winthrop student, and there will be
         two divisions (see information below).  There will also be <b>cash prizes</b> for the winning teams in each division! </p>
        
      <br>
      <h3>Teams &amp; Participation</h3>
      <p>Any current Winthrop student can participate.  The competition will consist of teams, where each team may have two or three students.
         We will have two divisions:      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Division 1:</b> All students in this division must have <i>successfully completed</i> CSCI 208.</li>
          <li><b>Division 2:</b> Only students that have <i>not</i> successfully completed CSCI 208 yet may complete in this division.  Students who currently enrolled in CSCI 208 participiate in Division 2.</li>
        </ul>
      <p><b>Note:</b> Students who are already on the official Winthrop programming team may participate; <i>however</i>, they must
         compete in Division 1 and no team in Division 1 may have more than one such team member.</p>
 
      <br>
      <h3>Competition Location &amp; Schedule</h3>
      <p>The competition will be held on <i>Saturday, March 30</i> in Carroll Hall.  The following is the tentative schedule:</p>
      <table border="1px">
        <tr>
          <td horizontal-align="center">9:30a &mdash; 10:00a</td> <td>Check-in and instructions</td> <td>Whitton Auditorium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td  horizontal-align="center">10:00a &mdash; 12:00p</td> <td>Practice round, getting used to the system</td> <td>Carroll 221/222</td>     
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td  horizontal-align="center">12:00p &mdash; 1:00p</td> <td>Lunch</td> <td>Thurmond 301 &amp; 303</td>                    
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td  horizontal-align="center">1:00p &mdash; 5:00p</td> <td>Competition</td>  <td>Carroll 221/222</td>                   
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td  horizontal-align="center">5:30p &mdash; 6:00p</td> <td>Awards &amp; Final Thoughts</td> <td>Whitton Auditorium</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <br>
      <h3>Judging &amp; Rules</h3>
      <p>All the teams in each division will be given between seven and ten <i>programming problems</i>.  They will use
         <a href="https://open.kattis.com/">OpenKattis</a> to submit potential solutions to these problems.  Each team
         may submit as many times to as many of the problems as they like during the competition time window.  The
         team with the most correct solutions will be the winner.  In the event of a tie, the team with fastest total
         times to solution will win.  Incorrect submissions will result in a 20-minute penality on the submission time
         for that submission.  A more careful description of the rules are provided <a href="https://open.kattis.com/contests/ymheft/rules">here</a>.</p>

      <p>In the event of a dispute, the judges will adjudicate the disagreement.</p>

      <p>Teams may use any printed materials they like, but they <b><i>cannot use any electronic devices</i></b> other than
        the computer provided for them by the contest itself.  Students may not coordinate with people outside
        of the contest while the competition is on-going.  In addition, students will be permitted only very limited network
        access from their assigned computer &mdash; i.e., no googling/LLM'ing the answer!</p>
      </p>

      <br>
      <h3>What Do We Get?</h3>
      <p>All students on the winning team in both divisions will receive <b>an $80 gift card</b>.
         All students on the second place team in both divisions will a receive <b>a $40 gift card</b>.
         These prizes will be donated by <a href="https://www.andersongriggs.com/">Anderson Griggs Investments</a>.
         We'll also likely have some fun swag for everyone!</p>
      <p>Additionally, we will provide lunch that Saturday.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>What Programming Language Can We Use?</h3>
      <p>You may use any programming language that <i>OpenKattis</i> accepts.  These include C++, Python, and Java.  
         You can find a <a href="https://open.kattis.com/languages">complete list here</a>.  Moreover, the computers in the room
         have VSCode installed, as well as a number of languages, including the three described above.</p>
